## Tabs Component

Implement a **Tabs Component** that allows users to switch between different tab content sections. Each tab should be clickable, and clicking on a tab should update the displayed content accordingly.

### Requirements

1. The component should accept a list of tabs as props.
2. Each tab should have a `title` and `content`.
3. The first tab should be selected by default.
4. Clicking on a tab should update the displayed content.
5. The component should be reusable and scalable.

### Constraints

- **Constraint 1**: The `tabs` prop is an array of objects, each containing `title` and `content`.
- **Constraint 2**: Handle an empty `tabs` array gracefully by displaying "No tabs available".
- **Constraint 3**: Handle cases where `title` is missing in a tab by displaying "Tab 1", "Tab 2", according to the tab number.
- **Constraint 4**: Handle cases where `content` is missing in a tab by displaying "No content available".
