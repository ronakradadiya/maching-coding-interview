### Create a 4-digit OTP (One-Time Password) input component using React.

The OTP should be entered one digit per input box. The focus should auto-move as the user types or deletes, and the component should support pasting a full OTP. It should also reject any non-numeric characters.

---

### Constraints & Edge Cases

* **Only numeric input is allowed.**
* If a box is **empty and backspace is pressed**, move focus to the **previous box**.
* **Paste** (e.g. "1234") should fill **all 4 boxes correctly**.

---

### Requirements

* Create a component that renders **4 input boxes**, each accepting **only one numeric digit**.
* **Automatically move focus to the next input** when a digit is entered.
* **Automatically move focus to the previous input** when backspace is pressed on an empty field.
* If the user **pastes the OTP** (e.g. "1234"), each box should fill with a digit.
* Once all 4 digits are entered, **trigger a callback `onChangeOTP`** and send the full OTP string.
* **Disallow any non-numeric input.**
