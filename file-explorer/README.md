## File Explorer - HARD

This project implements a dynamic and recursive file explorer component in React. It mimics the behavior of a typical file system viewer, where folders can be expanded or collapsed, and users can add or remove files and folders at any level of the hierarchy.

### Key Features:

* **Recursive Rendering:** Folders can contain nested folders/files to any depth, handled with recursion.
* **Expand/Collapse UI:** Each folder has toggle icons (using `react-icons`) to show/hide its contents.
* **Add Items:** Users can add a file or folder inside any existing folder dynamically.
* **Remove Items:** Files or folders (and their children) can be removed instantly.
* **State Management:** The file tree is managed using React `useState`, and state updates propagate through the recursive structure.
* **Minimal Styling:** Clean, readable layout using inline styles and icons for better UX.

A modal appears when users click "Add Folder" or "Add File". The modal should contain:

* An input field (`<input>`) where users can type the name of a new file or folder.
* An Add button (`<button>`) to submit the name.
* A Cancel button (`<button>`) to close the modal without making any changes.

### Icons Used:

* **MdExpandMore** – Folder collapsed
  → `import { MdExpandMore } from "react-icons/md"`
* **MdExpandLess** – Folder expanded
  → `import { MdExpandLess } from "react-icons/md"`
* **MdDeleteOutline** – Delete file/folder
  → `import { MdDeleteOutline } from "react-icons/md"`
* **FiFolderPlus** – Add new folder
  → `import { FiFolderPlus } from "react-icons/fi"`
* **AiOutlineFileAdd** – Add new file
  → `import { AiOutlineFileAdd } from "react-icons/ai"`

### Test ID Instructions:

You need to ensure that `data-testid` attributes are added to the relevant elements.

* For the "Delete" icon, add:
  `data-testid="delete"` to each delete button.

* Add:
  `data-testid="add"` to the "Add" button inside the modal.

* Add:
  `data-testid="cancel"` to the "Cancel" button inside the modal.

* For the "Add Folder" icon, add:
  `data-testid="add-folder-{id}"`
  where `{id}` is the ID of the folder.

* For the "Add File" icon, add:
  `data-testid="add-file-{id}"`
  where `{id}` is the ID of the file.
